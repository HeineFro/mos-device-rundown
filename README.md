# mos-device-rundown
MOS Device - Runddown
Communicates with a NRCS via mosprotocol

This is made with a lot of inspiration from https://github.com/nrkno/sofie-mos-connection

Mos device gets active rundowns and saves them as json, and then publish them on http://host:port/mosactive so they can be downloaded.
The downloaded rundowns are saved by there rundown ID - To download, get ID from the mosactive url, and go for http://host:port/rundowns/(roID).json

The xml from the NRCS is converted to json, and the initial <mos> tags is removed

This device is ment to work with a middelware(https://github.com/HeineFro/mos-casparcg-rundown
)that filters the rundown and extracts graphic elements to by played out on CasparCG
To add graphic elements in the NRCSÂ´s rundowns a plugins is needed, but thats other story

This is only tested with Octopus.
