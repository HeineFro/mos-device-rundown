MOS Device - Runddown
Communicates with a NRCS via mosprotocol
I could not have made this without a lot of inspiration from nrkno/sofie-mos-connection


Mos device gets active rundowns and saves them as json, and then publish them on http://host:port/mosactive so they can be downloaded.
The downloaded rundowns are saved by there rundown ID - To download, get ID from the mosactive url, and go for http://host:port/rundowns/<id>.json

oh by the way, the xml from the NRCS is converted to json

This device is ment to work with a middelware(cg-com-rundown)that filters the rundown and extracts graphic elements to by played out on CasparCG
To add graphic elements in the NRCSÂ´s rundowns a plugins needs to run inside, but thats other story

This is only tested with Octopus.
